// GpuParticles.h /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// The device half of the GPU particle path (docs/plans/GPU-PARTICLES.md in the wrapper): a ring of
// spawn records written once at birth, a table of system entries, one texture array for every
// particle texture, and the passes that age the ring in closed form and draw it.  The bookkeeping
// (which slot a system has, where the ring's head and tail are, what died) is the particle
// manager's, in W3DParticleSys.cpp; this only holds what the device holds.
//
// DX11GpuParticles.cpp is the Direct3D 11 answer.  GpuParticlesUnsupported.cpp answers for every
// build without one, where Supported is false and the particle manager never asks for the rest.
