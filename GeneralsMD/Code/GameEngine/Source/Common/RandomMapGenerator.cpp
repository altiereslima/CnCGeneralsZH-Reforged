	basins than usual and keeps them apart, a river map is cut in two with fords across it, and a
	canyon map has a few long gorges winding through it. A black forest is low ground under one
	wood from edge to edge, with clear rides cut through it from every base to the middle and round
	the ring of bases; trees do not stop a tank in this game, so the rides are the lanes an army
	can be seen in, not walls. A massif map lifts the middle into one table of high ground with a
	cliff all round it and a ramp up from each base's side. The starts, the money and every
