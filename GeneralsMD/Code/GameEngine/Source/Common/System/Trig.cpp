/* EA wrote an integer fixed point trig table here and then switched it off with
	 "#define DEFAULT_TRIG", which routed every call straight back to sinf, cosf,
	 tanf and acosf.  Their own comment above the switch says what it was for:
	 "use a precalculated lookup table for speed and repeatability across
	 different machines".  The repeatability is the part that matters, and the
	 shipped game does not have it.

	 The table now lives one layer down, in WWMath/dettrig.cpp, because the game
	 is not the only thing that needs it: Matrix3D::Rotate_Z and
	 Matrix3D::Get_Z_Rotation are what an object's facing actually round trips
	 through every frame, and those are WWMath's.  One table, one set of answers,
	 used by both sides.  See dettrig.h for why any of this is necessary and
	 Tools/gentrigtables.py for the error budget.

	 What is left here is the game's spelling of the same seven functions. */
