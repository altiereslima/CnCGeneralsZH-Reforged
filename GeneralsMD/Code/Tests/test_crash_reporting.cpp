/* C5: what a crash leaves behind off Windows, from the real CrashHandlerPosix.cpp.  This program runs
	 itself as a child for each way of crashing - "test_crash_reporting --crash <kind>" - in a user data
	 folder of its own, and checks how the child died and what it wrote:

	 - it died of the signal, as it would have without the handler (the handler re-raises), or of
		 SIGABRT after an exception nothing caught;
	 - ReleaseCrashInfo.txt has ReleaseCrash's sections in order, the reason, the fault address, a
		 register line, the bytes at the PC, the raw frames, and in the named pass the function that
		 crashed;
	 - the debug log (a file the child hands the handler, as Debug.cpp does) got the same report.

	 Armed controls, which must NOT leave a report: a child that never installs the handler, and a stack
	 overflow on a thread with no alternate stack (the handler cannot run without one).

	 The children switch macOS's crash reporter off for themselves only, so a run leaves no reports in
	 ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports; the game does not, and its crashes are reported as any app's are.

	 Not covered: the named pass's names for code outside this executable, a crash while the report is
	 being written, and a debugger taking breakIntoDebugger's SIGTRAP before the handler does (measured
	 by hand under lldb, C5).  "--crash break" is the child to run for it. */
