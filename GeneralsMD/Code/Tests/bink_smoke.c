/*
 * bink_smoke - checks the reconstructed Bink ABI in Libraries/Source/WWVegas/
 * Bink/include/bink.h against the real BINKW32.DLL the game ships.
 *
 * Nothing in that header could be taken from an SDK, so the two things it had
 * to guess are exactly what this proves:
 *
 *   1. the BINK struct's leading fields - Width/Height/Frames/FrameRate/
 *      FrameRateDiv are compared against the same values read straight out of
 *      the .bik file header, so a shifted offset shows up as a mismatch;
 *   2. the BINKSURFACE* constants - one frame is decoded twice, once as 32 bit
 *      and once as 24 bit, and the two must agree pixel for pixel.
 *
 * It loads ".\\BINKW32.DLL" by an explicit path on purpose (a backslash: LoadLibrary
 * does not take forward slashes in a path, it would fall back to the search
 * order and find the stub next to this exe): the plain name would
 * find the no-op stub sitting next to this exe in the build tree.  Run it with
 * GeneralsMD/Run as the working directory (CTest does).  With no game data it
 * reports "skip" and passes - Run/ is not in the repo.
