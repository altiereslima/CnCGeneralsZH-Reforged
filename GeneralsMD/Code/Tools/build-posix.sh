# The build behind build-macos.sh and build-linux.sh at the repository root, which are the commands to
# run; this is the POSIX half of build.bat, with the same arguments after the platform:
#
#   build-posix.sh <macos|linux> [clean] [Release|RelWithDebInfo|Debug] [test|<target>]
#
# From a fresh clone it checks the toolchain and names what to install when something is missing,
# fetches the third-party sources EA stripped and the fork's own art (vendor.sh), configures, builds,
# runs ctest when asked, and stages a game that runs:
#
#   macOS   build-mac/Zero Hour Reforged.app (the macos_app target)
#   Linux   build-linux/ZeroHourReforged/, the layout of the Linux package: bin/generals, and the staged
#           overlay at share/zero-hour-reforged/overlay, a link into the build tree
#
# Either one finds the player's Zero Hour by itself, or asks for its folder on the first start. The
# *.big stay where the install has them.
#
# The knobs below are overrides and every one of them empty is the supported path. A machine that
# does need one puts its own lines in build.local.sh at the repository root, which is git-ignored and
# read right after these defaults, rather than editing a tracked file.
