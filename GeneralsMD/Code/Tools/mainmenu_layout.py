"""Add the campaign pick and campaign mission panels to the main menu layout.

Picking USA, GLA or China in the single player menu opens a panel with a button for each of that
campaign's missions, so a campaign can be started at any mission; the difficulty panel follows the
pick as it always did.  The panel is the single player menu's own (MapBorder: six buttons in a
frame) cloned whole and renamed, which is how it keeps EA's frame, button art, font and sounds, and
then grown by two buttons, since the original 2003 campaigns run to seven missions:

    MapBorder5 / EarthMap5
        ButtonMission1 .. ButtonMission7     the campaign's missions, top to bottom
        ButtonMissionBack                    back to the pick panel or the single player menu

MainMenu.cpp shrinks the frame to the campaign it shows and moves Back up under its last mission.

When the side's original Generals campaign is installed, a pick panel comes first, the multiplayer
menu's (MapBorder1: two buttons and Back) cloned the same way:

    MapBorder6 / EarthMap6
        ButtonCampaignGenerals               the original 2003 campaign
        ButtonCampaignZH                     Zero Hour's campaign
        ButtonCampaignBack                   back to the single player menu

It is PICK_WIDEN wider than the other panels, to the left, so "GENERALS ZERO HOUR" fits its button
at 800x600 (211 pixels of Arial at 15 points against 208); the right edges stay in line.  The
recent-save buttons under the extra strip are never shown.

Both sit where the single player menu does, which is hidden while either shows.  The labels
are set from GUI:CampaignMission, GUI:CampaignZeroHour and GUI:CampaignGenerals; the transitions
that flash them in and out are in Data/INI/WindowTransitionsReforged.ini.

    python bigfile.py extract ../../Run/WindowZH.big "Window\\Menus\\MainMenu.wnd" -o wnd
    python mainmenu_layout.py wnd/Window/Menus ../Data/Window/Menus

The output is a tracked master under Code/Data; the build copies it to Run/Window/Menus/, where a
loose file beats WindowZH.big.

    python mainmenu_layout.py selfcheck

reads the tracked files back and checks they agree: the layout carries every window the code and
the Reforged transitions name, and Patch.str carries the labels.  Run by CTest as
mainmenu_selfcheck.
