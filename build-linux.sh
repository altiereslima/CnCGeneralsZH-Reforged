# Build Zero Hour Reforged on Linux, from a fresh clone, in one command. build.bat's arguments:
#
#   ./build-linux.sh                    check the toolchain, fetch, configure, build Release, stage the game
#   ./build-linux.sh Debug              another configuration (Release|RelWithDebInfo|Debug)
#   ./build-linux.sh Release test       the same, with ctest before the staging
#   ./build-linux.sh Release generals   build a single target, and nothing else
#   ./build-linux.sh clean              delete build-linux/ and start again
#
# Needs a C++ compiler, CMake, Ninja and SDL3's X11, Wayland and Vulkan headers; it prints the apt, dnf
# or pacman command when something is missing. The result is build-linux/ZeroHourReforged/bin/generals.
# GeneralsMD/Code/Tools/build-posix.sh does the work, shared with build-macos.sh. The release packages
# (AppImage, .deb, .rpm, Arch, Flatpak) are GeneralsMD/Code/Tools/linux-packages.sh's.
